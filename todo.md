# Todo List

## Required TODO
- Add HTMX functionality to everything
- Send emails to testees once their tests are graded
- Add a demo (next step is to add dummy demo data and add licensing key information to the contact page)
    - Add a homepage card which tells the user "this is a demo" or "see the demo"
    - Change the user search page to tell the user what last name to search for the demo
    - Add information to the contact page about the licensing key


## Additional Possible Functionality
- Add "most recent testee" to the dashboard
- Add a testee queue
- Add dynamic grading to leader/follower test pages
- Add dynamic form validation to leader/follower test pages
- Add dynamic form validation to the sign up/login pages
- Add pagination/active search to the test summary list page
- Add organizations to the users so that different clubs can use this

## Pretty TODO
- Make my errors not just display unformatted HTML cause I'm lazy...
